<p align="center">Fast, responsive, self-hosted image gallery. Ships minimal JS to the client.</p>

[Mus√©e](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/mus%C3%A9e) (pronounced myu-zay) was written primarily to experiment around with https://remix.run/ but now re-written using https://astro.build. Until now I had been using the _ excellent_ [`waschinski/photo-stream`](https://github.com/waschinski/photo-stream) gallery for hosting my images but felt limited with having to use Ruby. The eventual goal of Mus√©e is to ship **ZERO** client side JS to the client while maintaining the masonry layout.

Unfortunately, a responsive masonry layout is [not possible](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45200955/11940280) without the use of client-side JS to determine the window size (used for calculating the number of columns). At least until [CSS Grid Masonry](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/#masonry-layout) becomes available.
